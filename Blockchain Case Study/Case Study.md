# Case Study

## Introduction and Overview

It is widely agreed that Fintech has disrupted the financial industry. Fintech can be subdivided into several distinct categories or domains, including accounting and expense management, blockchain and crypto, , digital banking and financial infrastructure,  insurance, lending, payments, billing, and money transfer, to name a few.

One of the most talked about domain is Blockchain. The technology is gaining in popularity everyday and it is expected to cause a major impact in the financial sector. Simply put, a Blockchain is a distributed “immutable” database that is not controlled by a single, central authority. Some benefits of blockchain technology include:
```
(1) Reduction in fraudulent activities in banking and financial sector -  Blockchain technology would help financial sector to get rid of some contemporary crimes that are taking place in today’s digital world through distributed applications.

(2) Efficiency- Since there is no centralized authority, transactions take place in real time through the peer to peer system

(3)  Smart Contracts-Blockchains facilitates the storage of any kind of digital information, including computer code that can be executed between two or more parties, this allows for smart contracts.
```
## OneLedger - What is it
In Canada, there are many players in the Blockchain Industry. One such Company is OneLedger, founded in 2018. The Founder and Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of OneLedger, David Cao is the Chairman of Canada China Blockchain Professional Association (CCBPA), and has over 13 years of cumulative experience in blockchain technology and enterprise architecture 

OneLedger is a Blockchain as a Service (BaaS) Solutions company, that uses its own Blockchain technology to support its customer’s blockchain needs. OneLedger builds customizations on top of their proprietary blockchain software with integrations into third party software systems and tools. Being first to market with a truly interoperable blockchain solution, they build, manage, and provide blockchain support for all their customers and have a blockchain EDI offering for Supply Chain EDI. 

## Why this matters

One Ledger seeks to address two of the major challenges in today’s blockchain technology: 

(1) There is no practical way to transfer value directly between different blockchains 

 At present it’s hard to transfer assets, from one blockchain to another without a centralized exchange. if we want to transfer digital assets ‘across’ chains, we have to do so by transferring the assets to intermediary centralized exchanges, using their in-house wallets and ledgers to swap assets, and then transferring the new assets to their corresponding blockchains. This is no doubt, time consuming, costly and involves substantial third-party risks


 The answer, through OneLedger, individuals and businesses can transfer assets from one public blockchain to another with ease. They simplify the adoption of blockchain from small businesses to enterprises. OneLedger’s interoperability feature makes it easier to transfer assets across multiple blockchains.


(2) Inability of businesses and individuals to easily deploy distributed applications (dApps) across multiple blockchain platforms
Today, to deploy dApps across multiple platforms, developers need to write smart contracts in multiple languages, depending on each platform of choice. This is, again, expensive, resource-intensive, and time-consuming, thereby making dApps practically infeasible, and largely ineffective for businesses.

The answer, Using OneLedger’s Software Development Kit (SDK), developers can write a ‘master smart contract’ for their dApp, and deploy the dApp simultaneously on multiple public blockchains. This eliminates the need for developers to write smart contracts in multiple languages, if they are to be deployed on multiple blockchains, as is the case today.

## The Technology - Why this may be interesting

OneLedger is a cross-chain app platform designed for developers to extend blockchain technologies. OneLedger enables businesses and individuals to build applications through OneLedger’s modularization tools, which will then communicate with OneLedger protocol using its Application Programming Interface (API) gateway. Their Protocol bridges the gap for enterprise applications by providing native connectivity to any centralized or decentralized system, allowing for seamless communication.

OneLedger protocol communicates with the sidechains, which in turn could be synchronized with any other public distributed ledger (like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Hyperledger etc.) that supports “hashed time lock contracts (HTLC) and payment channels

### Blockchain EDI
OneLedger has developed a Supply Chain EDI solution on their proprietary Blockchain. Blockchain EDI is intended to save customers transactional costs for sending and receiving EDI messages as well as create efficiencies in messaging, while automating workflows. 

The problem: Traditionally, supply chain has used Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) as means to communicate purchase orders and invoices across multiple parties within a network. This relies on a standardized schema which has been altered and manipulated over time by different entities leading to much complexities. This process also relies on Value Added Networks (VANs) that aid in the translation and distribution of EDI transactions. 

Solution: OneLedger Blockchain EDI Network, will seamlessly integrate with current ERP systems and allow for manufacturers, distributors and retailers to transfer Purchase Orders and Invoices in a cost and time efficient manner.

### Real Estate Blockchain
OneLedger's Real-Estate offering allows the tokenization of real-estate assets on the OneLedger Blockchain.

This Real Estate Solution offering provides an optimal solution for multiple parties to share property information across several organizations, including Government Authorities, Real Estate Brokerages and Land Registries. Providing secure and transparent data to any entity that wishes to gain access. Simply launch a full node on the network or apply to be a validator to gain fast and easy access to real estate data backed by OneLedger’s lightening fast blockchain protocol.

### Real Estate Tokenization
Tokenizing Real Estate properties as digital assets are just the first step into many different industries including Decentralized Finance. We provide quick and easy access into asset ownership for property resale or for asset backed lending. In the future, this platform can easily be used for mortgage backed securities

### Cloud Agnostic
OneLedger's Private Consortium Blockchain is cloud agnostic. Customers can choose any cloud provider or bare-metal servers to host their blockchain. Customers can even choose a multi-cloud option.

### Identity Management System
OneLedger uses a Smart Identity Management System to allow enterprises to:
*	define roles and a trust hierarchy for nodes that participate in consensus on their permissioned network, and
*	control read and write access for node operators on their permissioned network.

This identity management is carried out across multiple distributed networks by assigning a master private/public key pair to each user, where the private key would be used to digitally sign all messages from a user on the network, thus linking users to their role in the business.

OneLedger protocol also uses public key authentication to create:
*	highly configurable digital wallets for individuals and institutions,
*	credit scores for businesses and consumers based on transaction history and behaviour on the network, and
*	arbitration mechanisms for tighter consensus if disagreements arise.

## Conclusion
Conclusion
	The services offered by OneLedger makes it easier for existing smaller companies to compete in the market place without having to spend a considerable sum on inhouse software infrastructures.  And for this same reason, it is now more feasible for prospective businesses to actually enter the market place, since initial capital outlay could be considerably reduced.
	

This kind of technology also contributes to the disruption in these fintech domain. Some entities that provide upgrades to these legacy systems may 
find that they are becoming less relevant as the blockchain technology eliminates the need for these upgrades.

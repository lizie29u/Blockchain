# Case Study

## Introduction and Overview

It is widely agreed that Fintech has disrupted the financial industry. Fintech can be subdivided into several distinct categories or domains, including accounting and expense management, blockchain and crypto, , digital banking and financial infrastructure,  insurance, lending, payments, billing, and money transfer, to name a few.

One of the most talked about domain is Blockchain. The technology is gaining in popularity everyday and it is expected to cause a major impact in the financial sector. Simply put, a Blockchain is a distributed “immutable” database that is not controlled by a single, central authority. Some benefits of blockchain technology include:
```
(1) Reduction in fraudulent activities in banking and financial sector -  Blockchain technology would help financial sector to get rid of some contemporary crimes that are taking place in today’s digital world through distributed applications.

(2) Efficiency- Since there is no centralized authority, transactions take place in real time through the peer to peer system
(3)  Smart Contracts-Blockchains facilitates the storage of any kind of digital information, including computer code that can be executed between two or more parties, this allows for smart contracts.

## OneLedger
In Canada, there are many players in the Blockchain Industry. One such Company is OneLedger, founded in 2018. The Founder and Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of OneLedger, David Cao is the Chairman of Canada China Blockchain Professional Association (CCBPA), and has over 13 years of cumulative experience in blockchain technology and enterprise architecture 

OneLedger is a Blockchain as a Service (BaaS) Solutions company, that uses its own Blockchain technology to support its customer’s blockchain needs. OneLedger builds customizations on top of their proprietary blockchain software with integrations into third party software systems and tools. Being first to market with a truly interoperable blockchain solution, they build, manage, and provide blockchain support for all their customers and have a blockchain EDI offering for Supply Chain EDI.  

One Ledger seeks to address two of the major challenges in today’s blockchain technology: 

(1) There is no practical way to transfer value directly between different blockchains 

 At present it’s hard to transfer assets, from one blockchain to another without a centralized exchange. if we want to transfer digital assets ‘across’ chains, we have to do so by transferring the assets to intermediary centralized exchanges, using their in-house wallets and ledgers to swap assets, and then transferring the new assets to their corresponding blockchains. This is no doubt, time consuming, costly and involves substantial third-party risks


 The answer, through OneLedger, individuals and businesses can transfer assets from one public blockchain to another with ease. They simplify the adoption of blockchain from small businesses to enterprises. OneLedger’s interoperability feature makes it easier to transfer assets across multiple blockchains.


(2) Inability of businesses and individuals to easily deploy distributed applications (dApps) across multiple blockchain platforms
Today, to deploy dApps across multiple platforms, developers need to write smart contracts in multiple languages, depending on each platform of choice. This is, again, expensive, resource-intensive, and time-consuming, thereby making dApps practically infeasible, and largely ineffective for businesses.

The answer, Using OneLedger’s Software Development Kit (SDK), developers can write a ‘master smart contract’ for their dApp, and deploy the dApp simultaneously on multiple public blockchains. This eliminates the need for developers to write smart contracts in multiple languages, if they are to be deployed on multiple blockchains, as is the case today.
